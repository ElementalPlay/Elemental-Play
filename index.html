<p>I am Erika Worman sole proprietor of Elemental Play where I taught and created pottery in Eugene for 25 years.
     My passion for ceramics began at Lane Community College in 1992 where a wheel throwing class opened me to a
      passion that will last a lifetime.  I am a third generation Oregonian and I recently returned home to the
       Newport area after raising two beautiful children in Eugene. As a family we enjoyed time in nature hiking
        and camping which ignited an interest in mushrooms and all things forrest. Inspired by the magic of mushrooms
         I started hand sculpting mushroom and tree fairy houses on altered thrown pots.  Spent any free time and
          money traveling the world with kids in tow.  One of the many things l learned traveling is people love
           little light weight affordable souvenirs made LOCALLY to tuck in their suitcases.  So my idea began to
            shrink my mushrooms and trees down to a size that fits on refrigerator magnets combine that with my
             love of my home state and here we are today.</p>
